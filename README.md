# ktordns

A simple DNS server implementation.

**Note:** This project was initially created when I was 14 years old as a high school admissions project and for fun. While it may not be production-ready, it demonstrates my early interest in networking and software development.

## Overview

ktordns is a basic DNS server. It's designed to handle simple DNS queries and provide responses. This project was primarily a learning exercise.

## Features

*   Handles basic DNS queries.
*   Simple and easy-to-understand codebase.

## Getting Started

To run ktordns, you'll need to have Kotlin and Gradle installed.

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/junepark678/ktordns.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd ktordns
    ```

3.  Build the project using Gradle:

    ```bash
    ./gradlew build
    ```

4.  Run the server:
